Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).

Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

### **Creational patterns**

provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [Abstract Factory](/designpatterns/creational/abstract-factory/)
- [Builder](/designpatterns/creational/builder/)
- [Factory Method](/designpatterns/creational/factory-method/)
- [Prototype](/designpatterns/creational/protoype/)
- [Singleton](/designpatterns/creational/singleton/)


### **Structural patterns**

explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

- [Adapter](/designpatterns/structural/adapter/)
- [Bridge](/designpatterns/structural/bridge)
- [Composite](/designpatterns/structural/composite/)
- [Decorator](/designpatterns/structural/decorator/)
- [Facade](/designpatterns/structural/facade/)
- [Flyweight](/designpatterns/structural/flyweight/)
- [Proxy](/designpatterns/structural/proxy/)


### **Behavioral patterns**

take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility](/designpatterns/behavioral/chain-of-responsibility/)
- [Command](/designpatterns/behavioral/command)
- [Iterator](/designpatterns/behavioral/iterator/)
- [Mediator](/designpatterns/behavioral/mediator/)
- [Memento](/designpatterns/behavioral/memento/)
- [Observer](/designpatterns/behavioral/observer/)
- [State](/designpatterns/behavioral/state/)
- [Strategy](/designpatterns/behavioral/strategy)
- [Template Method](/designpatterns/behavioral/template-method/)
- [Visitor](/designpatterns/behavioral/visitor/)
- [Interpreter](/designpatterns/behavioral/interpreter/)
