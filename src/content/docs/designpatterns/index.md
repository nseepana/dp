Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).

Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Factory Method
    - Prototype
    - Singleton


- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State 
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor
    - Interpreter
