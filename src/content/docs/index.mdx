Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).

Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

### **Creational patterns**

provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [Abstract Factory](/designpatterns/creational/abstract-factory/)
- [Builder](/designpatterns/creational/builder/)
- [Factory Method](/designpatterns/creational/factory-method/)
- [Prototype](/designpatterns/creational/protoype/)
- [Singleton](/designpatterns/creational/singleton/)


### **Structural patterns**

explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

- [Adapter](/designpatterns/structural/adapter/)
- [Bridge](/designpatterns/structural/bridge)
- [Composite](/designpatterns/structural/composite/)
- [Decorator](/designpatterns/structural/decorator/)
- [Facade](/designpatterns/structural/facade/)
- [Flyweight](/designpatterns/structural/flyweight/)
- [Proxy](/designpatterns/structural/proxy/)


### **Behavioral patterns**

take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility](/designpatterns/behavioral/chain-of-responsibility/)
- [Command](/designpatterns/behavioral/command)
- [Iterator](/designpatterns/behavioral/iterator/)
- [Mediator](/designpatterns/behavioral/mediator/)
- [Memento](/designpatterns/behavioral/memento/)
- [Observer](/designpatterns/behavioral/observer/)
- [State](/designpatterns/behavioral/state/)
- [Strategy](/designpatterns/behavioral/strategy)
- [Template Method](/designpatterns/behavioral/template-method/)
- [Visitor](/designpatterns/behavioral/visitor/)
- [Interpreter](/designpatterns/behavioral/interpreter/)

## Patterns Enchant on Ramayana:

In the mythical land of Ayodhya, there lived three extraordinary individuals: **Rama**, **Hanuman**, **Vibhishana**, and two young warriors, **Lava** and **Kusa**. Each of them embodied unique talents and perspectives, and their adventures would showcase the significance of design patterns through the epic tale of Ramayana.

**Rama**, the embodiment of righteousness and valor, was the epitome of Creational Patterns. He sought to build a grand alliance to rescue his beloved wife, Sita, who had been kidnapped by the demon king Ravana. Rama employed the **Builder Pattern** as he assembled a diverse team of allies, each with their specialized skills. The wise sage Valmiki played the role of the director, meticulously shaping Rama's allies to complement each other's abilities. The alliance, consisting of monkeys, bears, and humans, stood united by a common cause, showcasing the power of the **Abstract Factory Pattern**.

**Hanuman**, the loyal and devoted monkey warrior, embodied the essence of Structural Patterns. As the emissary to Lanka, Hanuman used the **Facade Pattern** to disguise his true identity and infiltrate Ravana's fortress. He skillfully navigated through the demon city, overcoming numerous obstacles with ingenuity. Additionally, he utilized the **Composite Pattern** by inspiring a team of monkeys to build a bridge across the vast ocean, connecting India to Lanka. The bridge's collective efforts demonstrated the strength and unity of purpose that Structural Patterns can bring.

Meanwhile, **Vibhishana**, Ravana's righteous brother, represented the Behavioral Patterns in Ramayana. When Vibhishana decided to defect from Ravana's side and join Rama's cause, he became an **Observer**. He keenly observed the injustices of his brother's rule and chose to align himself with Dharma (righteousness). His defection acted as a catalyst for positive change in the story, displaying the significance of the **Observer Pattern** in recognizing opportunities for transformation.

Vibhishana also embodied the **Strategy Pattern** during the war between Rama's army and Ravana's forces. He served as an advisor to Rama, providing strategic counsel and insights into Ravana's weaknesses. His expertise in understanding the demon king's tactics allowed Rama to employ effective counter-strategies, leading to the ultimate victory of righteousness over evil.

Amidst the war, Rama discovered that he had twin sons, Lava and Kusa, who were raised by Sage Valmiki. Lava and Kusa inherited their father's bravery and righteousness, and they were destined to play significant roles in the unfolding saga.

As the young warriors learned about their heritage, they embraced their destiny and joined Rama's army. Lava and Kusa represented the essence of the **Singleton Pattern**, as there could only be one pair of sons for Rama and Sita, and they stood united as a symbol of their family's strength and determination.

During the climactic battle, Lava and Kusa demonstrated their prowess in combat, embodying the **Decorator Pattern**. They wielded weapons crafted with intricate designs, showcasing their artistic abilities while also being formidable warriors. Their decorated weapons became iconic symbols of courage and valor, inspiring soldiers across both armies.

The tale of Rama, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Lava, and Kusa, whose adventures showcased the significance of design patterns in Ramayana, continued to inspire generations. The victory of righteousness, the power of unity, and the strength of family bonds remained eternal lessons that transcended time and space. The legacy of Ramayana and its profound connection to design patterns would forever live in the hearts and minds of those who cherished its teachings.

## Patterns Enchant on diversity

Once upon a time, in the vast and diverse land of India, a tapestry of history unfolded, showcasing the power of unity in diversity through the ages.

**The Creational Pattern** of India's diversity can be traced back to ancient times. Millennia ago, this land saw the birth of numerous civilizations, each contributing to its rich cultural mosaic. From the Indus Valley Civilization to the Vedic era, various ethnic groups and tribes coexisted, establishing their unique identities and leaving behind a legacy of art, literature, and architecture.

As time passed, **The Structural Pattern** of India's diversity evolved with the rise and fall of mighty empires. The Maurya, Gupta, and Mughal dynasties embraced inclusivity, fostering religious and cultural harmony. The grand architectures of ancient temples, magnificent forts, and awe-inspiring mosques stood as testaments to the fusion of diverse architectural styles.

However, with the advent of colonial rule, India faced a period of turmoil, as **The Behavioral Pattern** of division emerged. Yet, even in the face of adversity, the spirit of unity persisted. The struggle for independence ignited the flame of nationalism, and leaders like Mahatma Gandhi emphasized non-violence and unity in the fight against oppression.

As India finally gained independence in 1947, a new era of **The Creational Pattern** began. The founding fathers of the nation embraced diversity and unity as the bedrock of the Indian Constitution. The diverse fabric of languages, religions, and cultures was woven into the national identity, safeguarded by the principles of secularism and democracy.

Over the years, **The Structural Pattern** of India's diversity further solidified as the country progressed. The federal system allowed states to retain their unique identities while being part of a united nation. The Panchayati Raj system empowered local communities to actively participate in decision-making, celebrating diversity at the grassroots level.

As India continued to evolve, **The Behavioral Pattern** of inclusivity and acceptance gained prominence. Cultural festivals like Diwali, Eid, Christmas, and others became celebrations for all, transcending religious boundaries. The colorful spectrum of art, music, dance, and cuisine enriched the nation's collective heritage.

India's diversity became its greatest strength, as it fostered innovation and adaptability. The nation's tech industry, for instance, thrived due to a diverse pool of talent and perspectives, reinforcing the importance of **The Behavioral Pattern** of inclusivity in nurturing creativity and progress.

As the story of India's diversity continues to unfold, it serves as an inspiration to the world. The tale of a land where myriad cultures, religions, languages, and traditions harmoniously coexist is a living example of the beauty and strength that emerge when design patterns of Creational, Structural, and Behavioral unity are embraced.

And so, the saga of India's diversity and its role in shaping a vibrant and inclusive nation echoes through the annals of history, a testament to the power of design patterns that celebrate the uniqueness of every individual, while weaving them together into a beautiful and diverse whole.
