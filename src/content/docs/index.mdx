Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).

Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

### **Creational patterns**

provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [Abstract Factory](/patterns/creational/abstract_factory/context/)
- [Builder](/patterns/creational/builder/context/)
- [Factory Method](/patterns/creational/factory/context/)
- [Prototype](/patterns/creational/protoype/context/)
- [Singleton](/patterns/creational/singleton/context/)


### **Structural patterns**

explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

- [Adapter](/patterns/structural/adapter/context/)
- [Bridge](/patterns/structural/bridgecontext/)
- [Composite](/patterns/structural/composite/context/)
- [Decorator](/patterns/structural/decorator/context/)
- [Facade](/patterns/structural/facade/context/)
- [Flyweight](/patterns/structural/flyweight/context/)
- [Proxy](/patterns/structural/proxy/context/)


### **Behavioral patterns**

take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility](/patterns/behavioral/chain_of_responsibility/context/)
- [Command](/patterns/behavioral/commandcontext/)
- [Iterator](/patterns/behavioral/iterator/context/)
- [Mediator](/patterns/behavioral/mediator/context/)
- [Memento](/patterns/behavioral/memento/context/)
- [Observer](/patterns/behavioral/observer/context/)
- [State](/patterns/behavioral/state/context/)
- [Strategy](/patterns/behavioral/strategycontext/)
- [Template Method](/patterns/behavioral/template_method/context/)
- [Visitor](/patterns/behavioral/visitor/context/)
- [Interpreter](/patterns/behavioral/interpreter/context/)


## Patterns Enchant on diversity

Once upon a time, in the vast and diverse land of India, a tapestry of history unfolded, showcasing the power of unity in diversity through the ages.

**The Creational Pattern** of India's diversity can be traced back to ancient times. Millennia ago, this land saw the birth of numerous civilizations, each contributing to its rich cultural mosaic. From the Indus Valley Civilization to the Vedic era, various ethnic groups and tribes coexisted, establishing their unique identities and leaving behind a legacy of art, literature, and architecture.

As time passed, **The Structural Pattern** of India's diversity evolved with the rise and fall of mighty empires. The Maurya, Gupta, and Mughal dynasties embraced inclusivity, fostering religious and cultural harmony. The grand architectures of ancient temples, magnificent forts, and awe-inspiring mosques stood as testaments to the fusion of diverse architectural styles.

However, with the advent of colonial rule, India faced a period of turmoil, as **The Behavioral Pattern** of division emerged. Yet, even in the face of adversity, the spirit of unity persisted. The struggle for independence ignited the flame of nationalism, and leaders like Mahatma Gandhi emphasized non-violence and unity in the fight against oppression.

As India finally gained independence in 1947, a new era of **The Creational Pattern** began. The founding fathers of the nation embraced diversity and unity as the bedrock of the Indian Constitution. The diverse fabric of languages, religions, and cultures was woven into the national identity, safeguarded by the principles of secularism and democracy.

Over the years, **The Structural Pattern** of India's diversity further solidified as the country progressed. The federal system allowed states to retain their unique identities while being part of a united nation. The Panchayati Raj system empowered local communities to actively participate in decision-making, celebrating diversity at the grassroots level.

As India continued to evolve, **The Behavioral Pattern** of inclusivity and acceptance gained prominence. Cultural festivals like Diwali, Eid, Christmas, and others became celebrations for all, transcending religious boundaries. The colorful spectrum of art, music, dance, and cuisine enriched the nation's collective heritage.

India's diversity became its greatest strength, as it fostered innovation and adaptability. The nation's tech industry, for instance, thrived due to a diverse pool of talent and perspectives, reinforcing the importance of **The Behavioral Pattern** of inclusivity in nurturing creativity and progress.

As the story of India's diversity continues to unfold, it serves as an inspiration to the world. The tale of a land where myriad cultures, religions, languages, and traditions harmoniously coexist is a living example of the beauty and strength that emerge when design patterns of Creational, Structural, and Behavioral unity are embraced.

And so, the saga of India's diversity and its role in shaping a vibrant and inclusive nation echoes through the annals of history, a testament to the power of design patterns that celebrate the uniqueness of every individual, while weaving them together into a beautiful and diverse whole.
