Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).

Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

### **Creational patterns**

provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [Abstract Factory](/designpatterns/creational/abstract-factory/)
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton


### **Structural patterns** 

explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy


### **Behavioral patterns** 
take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memeno
- Observer
- State 
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
- Interpreter
