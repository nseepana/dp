### Purpose

The Command Pattern's primary purpose is to decouple sender and receiver in a way that allows multiple requests to be handled in a flexible and extensible manner. By encapsulating a request in an object, it enables parameterization of clients with different requests and supports undoable operations.

### Context

The Command Pattern is most useful in scenarios where you have an object that needs to send requests to perform actions on other objects, but you want to decouple the sender and receiver. This pattern is commonly used in GUI applications, multi-level undo/redo functionalities, transaction systems, and other scenarios where request handling and execution need to be managed in a flexible and extensible manner.

### Participants

1. Command: Interface or abstract class that declares an `execute()` method, which represents the action to be performed.
2. ConcreteCommand: Implements the Command interface, binding a specific action to a receiver. It knows the receiver and invokes the appropriate operations.
3. Client: Initiates the request to execute a particular command.
4. Invoker: Asks the command to carry out the request.
5. Receiver: Knows how to perform the operations associated with the command.

### Flow

1. The client creates a specific Command object and sets its receiver (the object that will perform the actual action).
2. The client then passes the Command object to the Invoker.
3. The Invoker stores the Command object (optional) and triggers the `execute()` method of the Command.
4. The Command object invokes the corresponding operation on the Receiver.
5. The Receiver performs the requested action.

### Mnemonic

**"Command Control"**

Explanation:

**"Command"**: Represents the Command Pattern, taking control over requests and actions by encapsulating them in objects, just like a commander leading his troops.

**"Control"**: Denotes the management of commands by the Invoker, orchestrating the execution of commands and maintaining order and flexibility.

Imagine a "Command Control" scenario where the Command Pattern acts as the commander, guiding and organizing different commands (ConcreteCommands) from various sources (Clients) to perform actions. Each command fulfills its mission, but they all follow the lead of the Command Pattern. The control center (Invoker) ensures seamless coordination, enabling new commands to join the operation without disturbing the established flow, creating a harmonious and efficient command structure.
