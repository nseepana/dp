title: Interpreter
description: Interpreter is a behavioral design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized computer language.

### Purpose


The purpose of the Interpreter pattern is to provide a way to evaluate and interpret a language or expression. It enables the creation of a domain-specific language (DSL) or the interpretation of complex grammatical constructs by breaking them down into simpler components. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with rule-based systems, mathematical expressions, or any situation where expressions need to be parsed and executed.

### Context


The Interpreter pattern is often used in software projects where there is a need to interpret expressions or languages. It falls under the category of behavioral design patterns and is employed to handle the grammar and semantics of a language or expression.

### Participants

1. ### Context

 The client or the environment in which the expressions need to be evaluated. It contains the global information required for interpretation.
2. **Abstract Expression:** An abstract class or interface that defines the interpretation interface. It usually includes an `interpret()` method, which is implemented by concrete subclasses.
3. **Terminal Expression:** Represents the smallest units of the grammar that can be directly interpreted. These expressions have no further subexpressions.
4. **Non-terminal Expression:** Represents composite elements of the grammar and contains other expressions (terminal or non-terminal) within it.

### Flow
1. The client defines the expressions or language to be interpreted and creates a corresponding syntax tree or abstract syntax tree (AST).
2. The client then creates concrete instances of the non-terminal and terminal expressions by implementing the abstract expression interface or subclassing the abstract expression class.
3. The expressions are assembled into a hierarchical structure, such as a tree, representing the syntax and semantics of the language or expression.
4. The client invokes the `interpret()` method on the root of the syntax tree, triggering the interpretation process.
5. The interpretation process recursively travels through the syntax tree, evaluating the expressions from the leaves (terminal expressions) up to the root (non-terminal expressions).
6. Each expression evaluates itself and can combine the results of its subexpressions to produce a final result.
7. The interpretation result is returned to the client, providing the outcome of the evaluated expression or language.

**Note:** The Interpreter pattern might require additional design patterns like Composite (for constructing the syntax tree) and Flyweight (to manage shared terminal expressions) to effectively implement complex language interpretations.

Overall, the Interpreter pattern offers a flexible and extensible way to handle different languages or expressions while keeping the grammar rules and evaluation logic separate from the client code. It promotes code reusability and maintainability in scenarios where language interpretation is a key aspect of the application.

### Mnemonic

**"Interpreting Ensemble"**

Explanation:

**"Interpreting"**: Represents the Interpreter pattern, which involves interpreting and evaluating expressions or languages.

**"Ensemble"**: Denotes the gathering of different elements (terminal and non-terminal expressions) that work together in harmony to produce meaningful results, just like an ensemble of musicians creating beautiful music together.

Imagine an "Interpreting Ensemble" where the Interpreter pattern orchestrates the collaboration between different expressions, much like a conductor guiding the musicians in an ensemble. Each expression plays its role in the performance, contributing to the overall interpretation process. The ensemble's adaptability allows new expressions to join without disrupting the harmony, making it a flexible and powerful tool for language interpretation in software development.
