## Purpose

The Interpreter Pattern is used to define a language or grammar and provide a way to evaluate or interpret expressions in that language. It is useful when there is a need to parse and process sentences or expressions according to specific rules or grammar.

## Context

The Interpreter Pattern is applicable in scenarios where there is a language or grammar that needs to be parsed and evaluated, such as mathematical expressions, query languages, or configuration languages. It is helpful when there is a need to define and enforce rules for processing expressions and when there is a desire to separate the parsing and evaluation logic from the client code.

## Participants

- **AbstractExpression**: Defines the interface or abstract class for the expressions in the language. It typically declares an interpret() method that takes a context and performs the interpretation.
- **TerminalExpression**: Implements the abstract expression and represents the terminal symbols in the language. It provides the implementation for the interpret() method.
- **NonterminalExpression**: Implements the abstract expression and represents the non-terminal symbols in the language. It can contain other expressions and provides the implementation for the interpret() method by combining or processing the sub-expressions.


The Interpreter Pattern defines a grammar or language by representing the different elements of the language as expressions. The expressions can be combined or nested to form complex expressions. The client code provides a context and passes it to the interpreter, which then evaluates or interprets the expressions according to the grammar rules.

This pattern allows for the creation of expressive and domain-specific languages by defining the rules and behavior of the language through the interpreter objects. It separates the parsing and evaluation logic from the client code, making it easier to extend and modify the language without affecting the client. The Interpreter Pattern is commonly used in compilers, interpreters, rule-based systems, and any scenario where there is a need to parse and evaluate expressions or languages.
