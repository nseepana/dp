# Behavioral

A **behavioral pattern** is a design pattern that focuses on the interaction and communication between objects, defining how objects and classes collaborate and fulfill their responsibilities. Behavioral patterns help in designing the behavior and communication patterns of objects in a system.

These patterns provide solutions for organizing, managing, and simplifying the interactions between objects, enabling them to work together effectively and efficiently. Behavioral patterns often emphasize the distribution of responsibilities and the flow of communication between objects.

Behavioral patterns typically involve the following key elements:

1. **Objects and Classes**: Behavioral patterns define how objects and classes interact and communicate with each other to achieve a specific behavior.

2. **Communication and Collaboration**: Behavioral patterns describe the patterns of communication and collaboration between objects, specifying the roles and responsibilities of each object.

3. **Algorithms and Control Flow**: Behavioral patterns define algorithms or control flow patterns that determine how objects interact, make decisions, and perform actions.

4. **Encapsulation of Behaviors**: Behavioral patterns often encapsulate complex behavior and interactions within specific objects or classes, promoting modularity and reusability.

**Patterns InShort**:

- **Observer**:
    one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Iterator**:
    sequentially access elements of collection without exposing underlying structure
- **Strategy**:
    define family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulate each one separately
- **Command**:
    encapsulate request as object
- **Chain of Responsibility**:
    establish chain of objects where each object has capability to handle specific type of request
- **State**:
    alter behavior when internal state changes
- **Visitor**:
    separate algorithm from objects it operates on
- **Template method**:
    define skeleton of algorithm in base class and allow subclasses to override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure
- **Memento**:
    save and restore state

1. **Observer** - Imagine a group of people observing a painting in an art gallery. The observer pattern represents the one-to-many relationship between the painting and the people observing it.

2. **Iterator** - Visualize a person using a remote control to sequentially access different channels on a television. The iterator pattern represents the sequential access of elements in a collection.

3. **Strategy** - Picture a person using different strategies to solve a puzzle. The strategy pattern represents the ability to select an algorithm at runtime.

4. **Command** - Imagine a person giving commands to a robot to perform different tasks. The command pattern represents the encapsulation of a request as an object.

5. **Chain of Responsibility** - Visualize a chain of people where each person has the ability to handle a specific request. The chain of responsibility pattern represents the delegation of requests along a chain of objects.

6. **State** - Imagine a person using a remote control to change the state of a television from on to off. The state pattern represents the ability to alter the behavior of an object when its internal state changes.

7. **Template Method** - Picture a person using a template to draw a shape. The template method pattern represents the ability to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allow subclasses to override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

8. **Visitor** - Imagine a person visiting different places in a city. The visitor pattern represents the ability to separate an algorithm from the object it operates on.

9. **Memento** - Visualize a person saving a file on a computer and restoring it later. The memento pattern represents the ability to save and restore an objectâ€™s state.

10. **Mediator** - Picture a person using a mobile phone to send a text message to another person. The mediator pattern represents the ability to define a common communication channel between a group of objects.

11. **Interpreter** - Imagine a person interpreting a sentence in a foreign language. The interpreter pattern represents the ability to define a language, its grammar, and an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
