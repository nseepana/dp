## Purpose

The State Pattern is used to manage the behavior of an object based on its internal state, without relying on large conditional statements. It allows an object to appear as if it changes its class at runtime, adapting to different scenarios or conditions.

## Context

The State Pattern is applicable in situations where an object's behavior varies based on its internal state, and there are multiple states with distinct behaviors that can be encapsulated. It is often used when there are state-specific operations or when the same behavior is implemented differently for different states.

## Participants

- **Context**: Defines the interface to the client and maintains a reference to the current state object. The context delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object.

- **State**: Defines an interface or abstract class that encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state. It declares methods that handle state-specific operations.

- **Concrete States**: Implement the state interface and provide specific implementations for the state-specific behavior. Each concrete state encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state.

The State Pattern allows the object's behavior to be easily extended or modified by adding new concrete state classes. It promotes loose coupling between the context and the state objects, as the context delegates its behavior to the current state. This pattern enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the system by separating state-specific behavior into individual classes, reducing the complexity of conditional statements, and enabling dynamic state transitions.
