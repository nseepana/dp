## Purpose
The Observer Pattern is used to achieve loose coupling between objects, allowing for a flexible and maintainable system where changes in one object can be propagated to multiple other objects without explicitly coupling them together.

## Context
The Observer Pattern is applicable in scenarios where there is a need for objects to maintain consistency and respond to changes in the state of another object, without tightly coupling them. It is commonly used in event-driven systems, user interfaces, and systems that require publish-subscribe mechanisms.

## Participants

- **Subject (Observable)**: Maintains a list of observers and provides methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers. It also manages the state that observers are interested in.
- **Observer (Subscriber)**: Defines an interface that allows the subject to notify changes. Observers register with the subject to receive notifications and update themselves accordingly.
- **Concrete Subject**: Inherits from the subject and implements specific behavior. It maintains the state and sends notifications to observers when the state changes.
- **Concrete Observer**: Implements the observer interface and defines the actions to be taken when notified by the subject.

The Observer Pattern promotes loose coupling, as the subject and observers interact through abstract interfaces. It allows for dynamic relationships between objects, as observers can be attached and detached at runtime. This pattern enables a flexible and scalable system where objects can react to changes in other objects' states in a decoupled and efficient manner.
