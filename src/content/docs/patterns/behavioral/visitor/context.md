title: Visitor
description: Visitor pattern used to separate algorithms or operations from the structure of the objects they work on.

### Purpose

 
The purpose of the Visitor pattern is to separate algorithms or operations from the structure of the objects they work on. It allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. The pattern achieves this by defining a new operation (the visitor) that is applied to all elements of the object structure, enabling dynamic dispatch and polymorphic behavior.

### Context

 
In software development, especially when dealing with complex object structures, it's often necessary to perform various operations on those structures without modifying their classes. Modifying the classes may not always be feasible or may violate the open/closed principle of software design. The Visitor pattern provides a way to encapsulate these operations in a separate class, allowing for flexibility and easy extensibility.

### Participants

1. Visitor: This is an interface or an abstract class defining the visit methods for each element type in the object structure. Each visit method represents an operation that can be performed on a specific element.
2. ConcreteVisitor: These are concrete implementations of the Visitor interface. Each ConcreteVisitor provides an implementation of the visit methods to define specific operations on elements of the object structure.
3. Element: This is an interface or an abstract class representing an element in the object structure. It declares an accept method that allows the Visitor to visit the element.
4. ConcreteElement: These are concrete implementations of the Element interface. Each ConcreteElement implements the accept method to call the appropriate visit method of the Visitor, allowing the Visitor to perform operations on it.
5. ObjectStructure: This is a collection or container that holds a group of elements. It provides a way for the Visitor to access and traverse the elements of the structure.

### Flow

1. The client code creates the elements (ConcreteElements) and adds them to the ObjectStructure.
2. The client code creates a ConcreteVisitor or uses an existing one, depending on the operation it wants to perform on the elements.
3. The client code calls the accept method of the elements in the ObjectStructure, passing the ConcreteVisitor as an argument.
4. Inside the accept method, the element calls the appropriate visit method of the ConcreteVisitor, passing itself as an argument.
5. The ConcreteVisitor performs the operation on the element based on the specific visit method implemented for that type of element.
6. The ConcreteVisitor can access the element's internal state and properties to perform its operation.
7. The process repeats for each element in the ObjectStructure, allowing the ConcreteVisitor to perform its operation on all elements without modifying their classes.

The Visitor pattern provides a powerful mechanism for adding new operations to a complex object structure without altering its elements, making it a useful tool for separation of concerns and enhancing code maintainability and extensibility.

### Real World Scenarios

1. **Code Refactoring**: Applying the Visitor pattern to refactor complex codebases and separate operations from object structures.
2. **Plugin System**: Implementing a plugin system where external modules (visitors) can operate on a core system (object structure) without modifying its code.
3. **AST Transformations**: Utilizing the Visitor pattern to traverse and transform abstract syntax trees in compilers and interpreters.
4. **GUI Event Handling**: Managing event handling in graphical user interfaces to perform various actions on GUI elements without tightly coupling the logic.
5. **Document Processing**: Parsing and processing various document formats with the Visitor pattern to apply different operations based on the document structure.
6. **Semantic Analysis**: Performing semantic analysis in compilers using the Visitor pattern to check for language-specific rules and constraints.
7. **Serialization/Deserialization**: Implementing custom serialization/deserialization logic on different data structures without modifying their classes.
8. **Visitor Analytics**: Collecting analytics data by applying visitor-like behaviors to track user interactions and behavior patterns.
9. **Database Operations**: Using the Visitor pattern to perform diverse database operations based on the types of database entities.
10. **Robotics Control**: Controlling robots by applying various actions using the Visitor pattern on their different components and sensors.

### Mnemonic

**"Versatile Voyage"**

Explanation:

**"Versatile"**: Embodies the purpose of the Visitor pattern, allowing flexible and dynamic operations (visits) on different elements of the object structure.

**"Voyage"**: Represents the traversal and journey through the object structure, where the Visitor explores and interacts with each element along the way, like embarking on a voyage through diverse destinations.
