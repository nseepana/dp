title: Builder
description: used to construct complex objects

---

### Purpose

The purpose of the Builder pattern is to simplify the construction of complex objects in a flexible and reusable manner. It allows for creating various versions of an object without being tied to its internal structure during the construction process.

### Context

The Builder pattern is applicable when:

- Dealing with complex objects that consist of multiple parts or configurations.
- Creating different versions of the object with varying features is required.
- Avoiding a lengthy and complicated constructor with numerous input parameters is desired.
- Separating the construction process from the final object, allowing easy changes or extensions to the building process, is beneficial.

### Participants

The main participants in the Builder pattern are:

- **Builder**: An abstract interface defining the steps to construct an object.
- **ConcreteBuilder**: Implementations of the Builder interface that provide specific methods to construct different versions of the object.
- **Product**: The complex object being constructed, composed of multiple parts.
- **Director**: An optional component that controls the construction process by interacting with the Builder.

### Flow

The flow of the Builder pattern is as follows:

1. The client code specifies the desired features of the object by using the methods provided by the Builder.
2. Once all the necessary details are provided through the Builder's methods, the client requests the Builder to create the final object.
3. The ConcreteBuilder, which implements the Builder interface, constructs the object based on the specified features.
4. The result is a fully built Product, representing the complex object with the desired configuration and features.

### Real-world Scenarios

1. **UI Widget Construction**: Creating complex user interface components with various configurations and styles without tightly coupling the construction process to the widgets' internal representation.

2. **Report Generation**: Generating different types of reports with varying data and formats, abstracting the report construction from the actual content.

3. **Configuration Management**: Constructing system configurations with multiple options and parameters while separating the configuration logic from the final representation.

4. **Document Assembly**: Assembling documents with dynamic content and layouts, allowing different types of documents to be built using the same construction steps.

5. **Meal Customization**: Building customized meals in a restaurant ordering system with different options for dishes, sides, and drinks, all handled independently by the builder.

6. **Object Serialization**: Serializing and deserializing objects to different formats while decoupling the serialization process from the object's internal structure.

7. **Maze Generation**: Creating mazes with varying sizes and complexities, abstracting the maze generation process from the specific maze structure.

8. **Vehicle Manufacturing**: Manufacturing vehicles with various features and configurations by using a builder to define the steps for constructing different types of vehicles.

9. **Game Character Creation**: Constructing game characters with customizable attributes, abilities, and appearance, providing flexibility to create diverse characters easily.

10. **Form Creation**: Building dynamic forms with different fields, validations, and layouts, separating the form creation process from the specific form representation.


### Mnemonic

**"Brick by Brick"**

Explanation:

"Brick": Think of the Builder pattern as building an object like stacking bricks, one by one.
"by": Step by step, the Builder constructs the complex object by adding its parts.
"Brick": Each part is like a brick, and the Builder assembles them to form the final object. Just like building a structure brick by brick, the Builder pattern constructs the object gradually, component by component.
