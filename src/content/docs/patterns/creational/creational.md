# Creational pattern

A **creational pattern** is a design pattern that focuses on the creation and instantiation of objects. It provides solutions for creating objects in a flexible and reusable manner, decoupling the client code from the specific classes or objects being instantiated.

Creational patterns help to manage the complexities of object creation, such as determining which concrete class to instantiate, configuring objects, and controlling the object creation process. They promote flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability by abstracting the instantiation logic.

Creational patterns typically involve the following key elements:

1. **Object Creation**: Creational patterns deal with how objects are created, including the instantiation of classes and the initialization of object properties.

2. **Decoupling**: Creational patterns aim to decouple the client code from the specific classes or objects being instantiated, allowing for more flexibility and interchangeability.

3. **Abstraction**: Creational patterns often involve abstracting the object creation process, providing a higher-level interface or factory to create objects.

4. **Configuration**: Creational patterns may provide mechanisms for configuring and initializing objects, allowing for flexible customization during the creation process.

By applying creational patterns, developers can achieve more flexible and maintainable object creation, promote code reuse, and improve the overall design and structure of their applications.

**Patterns InShort**:

- **Singleton**: 
  ensures a single instance of a class
- **Factory**: 
  provides an interface for creating objects
- **Abstract**: 
  creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes
- **Builder**: 
  separates object construction from its representation
- **Prototype**: 
  creates objects by cloning existing objects

**Mnemonic**: **ABFPS**

1. **Singleton** - Imagine a crown worn by a king. Just like a crown represents the uniqueness and singularity of a king, the singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class can exist.

2. **Factory Method** - Visualize an assembly line in a factory where different raw materials and components are transformed into a finished product. The factory method pattern represents the process of creating objects in a similar way.

3. **Abstract Factory** - Picture a factory that produces different types of products, such as a car factory that manufactures cars, SUVs, and motorcycles. The abstract factory pattern allows the creation of families of related objects.

4. **Builder** - Imagine a construction site with builders and construction workers building a house. The builder pattern represents the step-by-step process of constructing complex objects.

5. **Prototype** - Visualize a photocopy machine making copies of a document. The prototype pattern allows the creation of new objects by cloning or copying existing ones.
