title: Facade
description: Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

### Purpose

The purpose of the Facade pattern in software development is to simplify the interaction with a complex system by providing a unified and straightforward interface. It aims to hide the underlying complexity of the system, making it easier for developers to use and understand.

### Context

When working on software projects, developers often encounter complex systems or sets of classes with intricate dependencies and interactions. This complexity can make it challenging to use and maintain the system effectively. The Facade pattern comes into play to address this issue, offering a solution to streamline the usage of the system and promote loose coupling between different components.

### Participants

There are three main participants in the Facade pattern:

1. **Facade**: This central participant acts as a mediator between the clients and the complex subsystems. It provides a simplified interface, shielding developers from the inner workings of the system. By doing so, it enables clients to interact with the system in a more straightforward and unified way.

2. **Subsystem classes**: These participants represent the complex subsystems or sets of related functionalities in the system. They may have intricate interactions and dependencies, making them difficult to handle directly.

3. **Client**: The client participant interacts with the Facade to access the functionalities of the complex system. Instead of dealing with the subsystem classes directly, the client uses the Facade's simplified interface, reducing the complexity and making their work more efficient.

### Flow

1. The developer encounters a complex system with intricate dependencies and interactions.

2. To simplify the system's usage, the developer decides to apply the Facade pattern.

3. They create a Facade class, which acts as a single entry point to the complex system.

4. The Facade class provides a simplified and unified interface that shields the developer from the underlying complexity of the subsystems.

5. The developer uses the Facade to interact with the system, accessing its functionalities in a straightforward manner.

6. By utilizing the Facade pattern, the developer promotes loose coupling between different parts of the system, reducing unnecessary dependencies.

7. The result is a more manageable and accessible system, with an easier and more efficient development process.

### Real World Scenarios

1. **API Facade**: Simplifying interaction with a complex API by providing a unified interface for clients, hiding underlying complexities of different endpoints.
2. **Subsystem Access**: Allowing a software module to access multiple subsystems through a single facade, reducing direct dependencies and promoting modularity.
3. **Legacy System Integration**: Integrating a legacy system into a modern application using a facade to encapsulate its intricacies and enable seamless interaction.
4. **UI Abstraction**: Creating a user interface facade to manage the complexity of underlying UI components, presenting a unified and user-friendly interaction for developers.
5. **Library Compatibility**: Providing a facade for an external library to ensure compatibility with different versions and allow developers to switch between library implementations easily.

### Mnemonic

**"Simplified Reception"**

Explanation:

**"Simplified"**: Signifies the purpose of the Facade pattern, simplifying complex systems for developers.

**"Reception"**: Represents the Facade acting as a welcoming host, providing a unified interface to invite developers to interact with the complex system. 

Imagine a "Simplified Reception" where the Facade pattern stands at the entrance, warmly welcoming developers. The Facade acts as the host, making the system's complexities disappear behind the scenes. Developers can now enjoy a smooth and streamlined experience, interacting with the system through the Facade's welcoming reception.
