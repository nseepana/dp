title: Structural Patterns
description: ""
---

A **structural pattern** focuses on the composition of classes and objects(instance of a class) to form larger structures and provide relationships between them.

It deals with how objects and classes are organized and connected to create larger structures and systems.

It help in organizing code, simplifying complex systems, and promoting code reuse.

It typically involve the following key elements:

1. **Classes and Objects**: Structural patterns define how classes and objects are structured and connected to each other.

2. **Composition**: Structural patterns emphasize the composition of objects to form larger structures or represent complex relationships.

3. **Interfaces**: Structural patterns define interfaces and interactions between objects, allowing them to work together effectively.

4. **Abstraction**: Structural patterns often involve abstracting and encapsulating the complexities of objects and their relationships.


**Patterns InShort**: [ABCD-FF-MP]

- **Adapter**:
     bridge between incompatible interfaces
- **Bridge**:
     decouples abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite**:
     treat a group of objects as a single object
- **Decorator**:
     add new functionality to an existing object dynamically
- **Flyweight**:
     minimizes memory usage by sharing data among objects
- **Facade**:
     simplified interface to a complex system
- **Mixin**:
     dynamically extend object functionality through mixins, Mixins are sometimes described as being "included" rather than "inherited".
- **Proxy**:
     Provides an intermediary object to control access to another object.

**Mnemonic Techniques**

- **Adapter** - Picture an adapter that allows you to plug in incompatible electronic devices, symbolizing how the adapter pattern bridges the gap between incompatible interfaces.

- **Bridge** - Visualize a bridge connecting two separate land masses, representing how the bridge design pattern connects the abstraction and implementation parts of a system.

- **Composite** - Visualize a group of musical notes coming together to form a harmonious chord, symbolizing how the composite pattern treats a collection of objects as a single object.
  
- **Decorator** - Picture a beautifully decorated cake, where new layers and decorations are added to enhance its appearance and taste, reflecting how the decorator pattern adds new functionality to an existing object dynamically.

- **Flyweight** - Imagine a flock of birds flying together, sharing the same set of feathers, thus minimizing the overall feather usage and conserving resources. This represents how the flyweight pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing data among objects.

- **Facade** - Imagine a building with an elegant and simple front (facade) that hides the complex inner workings of the building.
  
- **Mixin** - Picture a painter's palette with various colors mixed together, representing the dynamic extension of object functionality through mixins. Just like the painter includes different colors into their artwork, objects can include mixin functionality dynamically.

- **Proxy** - Imagine a receptionist at the entrance of an office building, controlling access to visitors and acting as an intermediary between them and the employees inside.


By creating these mental images and associations, you can form vivid connections between the terms and their corresponding concepts, making it easier to recall them when needed.

**[In Detail](./index)**

**Glossary**:

- A **class** is an abstract concept that defines the common structure and behavior of a group of objects.

- An **object** is a concrete instance created from a class and represents a specific entity with its own state and behavior.

- A **concrete class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while a **concrete instance** is a specific object created from that class.
