title: Flyweight
description: Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows programs to support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low.

### Purpose

The purpose of the Flyweight pattern in software development is to optimize memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects. By doing so, it aims to reduce the overall memory footprint of the application. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have similar characteristics and share a significant amount of data. By sharing this common data, the Flyweight pattern helps to minimize the memory consumption, making the application more efficient.

### Context

The Flyweight pattern finds its application in situations where an application needs to handle numerous objects with similar attributes and significant shared data. Creating separate objects for each instance can lead to high memory consumption. The Flyweight pattern steps in to address this issue by allowing multiple objects to share the same data. This pattern is most beneficial when the memory usage of individual objects can be optimized by sharing common data, resulting in a more streamlined and resource-friendly solution.

### Participants

The main participants in the Flyweight pattern are:

1. **Flyweight**: This participant represents the interface or abstract class that defines the common methods and properties shared among the flyweight objects.

2. **Concrete Flyweight**: These participants are the concrete implementations of the Flyweight interface. They store the intrinsic (shared) state that can be shared across multiple objects.

3. **Flyweight Factory**: The Flyweight Factory is responsible for creating and managing the flyweight objects. It ensures that flyweights are shared and reused effectively, reducing unnecessary object duplication.

### Flow

The flow of the Flyweight pattern can be described as follows:

1. The Flyweight Factory creates and manages a pool of flyweight objects.

2. When a client code needs a flyweight object, it requests one from the Flyweight Factory.

3. If a requested flyweight object with specific intrinsic state already exists in the pool, the Flyweight Factory returns that shared instance.

4. If the requested flyweight object does not exist, the Flyweight Factory creates a new instance, adds it to the pool, and then returns it to the client.

5. The client can use the flyweight object obtained from the Flyweight Factory, providing any necessary unique (extrinsic) data.

6. Multiple clients can use the same flyweight object concurrently, reducing memory usage by reusing the shared intrinsic state.

7. With the Flyweight pattern, the application optimizes memory consumption, leading to improved performance and efficiency.

### Real World Scenarios

1. **Caching Mechanism**: Using the Flyweight pattern to store and reuse frequently accessed data to improve application performance.
2. **Text Editors**: Employing the Flyweight pattern to handle multiple character instances efficiently and reduce memory usage.
3. **Graphic User Interfaces (GUI)**: Applying the Flyweight pattern to manage and display similar graphical elements across the user interface.
4. **Database Connection Pooling**: Utilizing the Flyweight pattern to share and manage database connections for multiple clients, reducing resource overhead.
5. **Game Development**: Implementing the Flyweight pattern to manage game objects with shared characteristics, such as textures or animations.
6. **Spelling and Grammar Checkers**: Using the Flyweight pattern to optimize the storage of language rules and reduce memory consumption.
7. **Web Servers**: Applying the Flyweight pattern to handle multiple concurrent requests and reuse resources efficiently.
8. **Financial Applications**: Utilizing the Flyweight pattern to manage and share currency exchange rate objects among various financial transactions.
9. **Network Protocol Handling**: Implementing the Flyweight pattern to efficiently process and manage protocol-specific data structures.
10. **Symbol Tables in Compilers**: Using the Flyweight pattern to handle the large number of symbols efficiently during compilation.

### Mnemonic

**"Flyweight Fiesta"**

Explanation:

**"Flyweight"**: Represents the Flyweight pattern, optimizing memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects.

**"Fiesta"**: Symbolizes the lively gathering of flyweight objects at a celebration hosted by the Flyweight pattern. Each object brings its unique characteristics, but they all share the joy of memory efficiency and reduced duplication. The fiesta highlights the efficiency and resource-friendly nature of the Flyweight pattern, making it a dynamic and enjoyable solution for software development scenarios.
