title: Bridge
description: Bridge pattern used to separate a main idea from how it's actually done.
---

### Purpose

The purpose of the Bridge pattern is to separate a main idea from how it's actually done, making them independent of each other. This way, changes to one part won't affect the other, providing a stable and flexible relationship.

### Context

The Bridge pattern is useful when we want to keep a main idea (called abstraction) separate from the specific way it's implemented (called implementation). By doing this, both the main idea and its implementation can change without causing problems.

### Participants

- **Abstraction**: This is like the main idea or blueprint. It defines how the main idea will work and keeps a link to the specific way it's done.
- **Refined Abstraction**: It's a more detailed version of the main idea. It adds extra features or details to the main idea.
- **Implementation**: This is the specific way the main idea is carried out. It provides the actual code for how the main idea's actions are performed.
- **Concrete Implementation**: It's a more specific version of the Implementation. It gives a detailed implementation of the main idea's actions.

### Flow

The Bridge pattern works like this:
1. We have a main idea (Abstraction) that has a connection to the specific way it's done (Implementation).
2. The main idea can be expanded into more specific versions (Refined Abstraction) if needed.
3. The specific way the main idea is done (Implementation) can also have different detailed versions (Concrete Implementation).
4. By separating the main idea from its implementation, we create a flexible system where both parts can change and evolve independently.

### Real World Scenarios

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing a login system for secure access to applications and websites.
2. **Database Abstraction**: Creating a layer to interact with different databases, allowing flexibility and easy switching between them.
3. **Device Compatibility**: Developing software that works seamlessly across various devices and platforms.
4. **Internationalization**: Adapting an application to support multiple languages and cultural preferences.
5. **Plugin Architecture**: Designing a system that allows dynamic addition of features through plugins or modules.
6. **Remote Method Invocation**: Enabling communication between distributed components in a networked system.
7. **Caching Mechanism**: Implementing a caching strategy to improve performance and reduce resource usage.
8. **Data Encryption**: Securing sensitive data by encrypting it to prevent unauthorized access.
9. **Event Handling**: Developing mechanisms to respond to and process events triggered by user interactions or system changes.
10. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implementing logging and monitoring features to track application behavior and detect issues.

### Mnemonic

**"Bridge Bash"**

Explanation:

**"Bridge"**: Symbolizes the Bridge pattern, bridging the gap between abstraction and implementation, just like a bridge connects two sides.

**"Bash"**: Represents the celebration of Concrete Implementations and Refined Abstractions coming together to enjoy the flexibility and evolution offered by the Bridge pattern.

Imagine a "Bridge Bash" where the Bridge pattern acts as the event planner, bringing together different abstraction ideas (Refined Abstractions) and their specific implementations (Concrete Implementations) to join the bash. Each abstraction and implementation pair brings its uniqueness to the party, but they all share the joy of being part of the Bridge pattern. The celebration encourages developers to create new abstractions and implementations without affecting each other, making the bash a harmonious and dynamic gathering.
